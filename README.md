# printf Project
## Concept
* Group Projects
* Pair Programming - How To
* Flowcharts
* Technical Writing

## Description
This team project is part of the first sprint of ALX SWE program. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

* How to use git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* The complexities of printf
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

Please these are the files we will create
main.h
_printf.c
main.h
man_3_printf
print_characters.c
print_numbers.c
select_flag.c
select_print.c
write_functions.c
Create the last three of them and I will create the other three. The readme and man page will be checked before the real work will be scored. I will indicate in the main.h which file to include what.

We are to provide the answers to the following tasks:
Task 0 - Write a function that produces output according to a format.
Task 1 - Handle the following conversion specifiers: d, i.
Task 2 - Handle the following custom conversion specifiers: b.
Task 3 - Handle the following conversion specifiers: u, o, x, X.
Task 4 - Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
Task 5 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: s, /x.
Task 6 - Handle the following conversion specifier: p.
Task 7 - Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: +, space, #.
Task 8 - Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l, h. Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X.
Task 9 - Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 10 - Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 11 - Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 12 - Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Task 13 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: r : prints the reversed string.
Task 14 - Handle the following custom conversion specifier: R: prints the rot13'ed string
Task 15 - All the above options work well together.
